    <p id="about-text" class="text-center mt-3 about-hidden">
        Translation Bridge is a platform designed to connect individuals and companies 
        with professional translators across the Kingdom. Our goal is to make the 
        translation process easier, faster, and more accessible by offering a smart 
        system that allows users to search for translators based on location, language, 
        and specialization.<br><br>

        Through Translation Bridge, clients can explore detailed translator profiles, 
        review their skills and experience, and choose the translator that best fits 
        their needs. Companies can also post translation requests, browse qualified 
        translators in their area, and collaborate directly with them through a seamless 
        and user-friendly interface.<br><br>

        The platform is built to support both sides of the translation industry—those 
        who need translation services and those who provide them—by creating a trusted 
        space that enhances communication, increases opportunities, and promotes quality 
        and professionalism in every translation project.
